        <h1 class="splash">Not long ago, finding a place to be an entrepreneur at Rutgers was hard. There was no network, no advice, and certainly no money. As entrepreneurs, we wanted to fix that. So we started RESx, a program run by the Rutgers Entrepreneurial Society dedicated to helping Rutgers startups succeed. Want to join?</h1><br>
        <h1 class="splash link">Just tell us your idea.</h1>
        <div id="info" class="info">
            <h1 class="info">We're the Rutgers Entrepreneurial Society,</h1>
            <h1 class="info">And we want to help you.</h1>
            <p>RESx is a 10-week accelerator program which runs 3 times per year. Our next session is taking place January - April and will be run by <a href='https://linkedin.com/in/nlusskin'>Nick</a> and <a href=''>Aidan</a></p>
            <p>The accelerator helps young startups of any type (tech, social, hardware, etc.) develop a great product, connect with mentors, raise capital, and launch to the world. We are centered at Rutgers, but are not focused there.</p>
            <p>Interested in joining? Fill out the short application below and we'll contact you for a long-form interview to take place during the last week of January</p>
